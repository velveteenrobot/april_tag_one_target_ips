April Tag Detection Node with Built in UEyeCamera thread.
--------------------------------------------------------
- This node has both april tag detection and the camera driver in one, to cut
  down on any copy overhead and transport delays.

- The Kaess April Tag library does all the heavy lifting. It has been modified
  to run faster (but is no longer robust against occlusions).

- By default only detected tag messages are published. The actual images can be
  published by enabling it through a ROS parameter.
